       <h1>This is how to prepair apple pancake.</h1>
       <p>This is as close as I have found to the apple pancake at the Original Pancake House. A fluffy, sweet pancake. Excellent with a scoop of vanilla ice cream</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
           <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
           <li>1 large apple, cored and sliced</li>
           <li>½ cup white sugar, divided</li>
           <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
           <li>4 eggs</li>
           <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
           <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
           <li>1 pinch salt</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>Step 1
            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
           <li>Step 2
            Melt butter in an oven-safe skillet over medium heat; cook and stir apple slices, about 1/4 cup sugar, and cinnamon in butter until apples are tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
           <li>Step 3
            Beat eggs, milk, flour, remaining 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, vanilla extract, and salt in a large bowl until batter is smooth; pour batter evenly over apples.</li>
           <li>Step 4
            Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 10 minutes. Run a spatula around the edges of the pancake to loosen. Invert skillet over a large plate to serve.</li>
       </ol>
