<h1>How to make tasty Avgolemono Soup</h1>
<p>Avgolemono is one of those soups that I've made many times, but rarely from scratch. It's usually a 'there's nothing in the house' type of thing and made with a carton of broth. Even in its quick-and-easy form it's a delicious and comforting meal, but when you use a fresh whole chicken, it becomes epic. Garnish with parsley and lemon zest.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 ribs celery, chopped</li>
    <li>1 carrot, chopped</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano leaves</li>
    <li>3 quarts cold water</li>
    <li>2 cups finely diced onion</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>⅔ cup arborio rice, or more to taste</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>½ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Step 1
        Place chicken, chopped onion, celery, carrot, bay leaves, and oregano in a large pot. Pour water over the top; bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, skimming foam as necessary, until chicken is falling off the bone, 60 to 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a bowl to cool, strain all vegetables from simmering broth, discard vegetables, and return broth to the pot. Chop cooked chicken meat.</li>
    <li>Step 2
        Combine 2 cups diced onion, olive oil, and a pinch of salt in a large skillet. Cook and stir onion mixture over medium heat until onion is soft, sweet, and golden, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Step 3
        Stir onion mixture into chicken broth in the pot and set over medium-low heat; add Arborio rice and a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until rice is very tender and broth flavors combine, about 45 minutes.</li>
    <li>Step 4
        Whisk eggs, cayenne pepper, and black pepper together in a bowl; whisk in lemon juice. Slowly pour 1 cup broth mixture into egg mixture, whisking constantly. Add 1 more cup of broth to egg mixture and whisk. Pour egg mixture into broth in the pot, add chopped chicken, and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes more.</li>
